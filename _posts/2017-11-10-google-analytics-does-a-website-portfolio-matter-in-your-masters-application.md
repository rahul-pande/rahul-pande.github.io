How important is it to include a website portfolio in your masters application? Despite of the availablility of a lot of website solutions out of the box, publishing a website still takes up a telling amount of time. Is it worth it to spend that time on deploying a website when you could in stead allocate that chunk of time in other aspects of application, may be put some extra sparkle into that Statement Of Purpose?

However, the second and more important question is- Does the admission committee even look at your website when you put a link inline the essay?
I asked this question to a lot of supposedly expert consultants. "Must be", "Most probably", "Umm, may be if they have enough time" were some of the answers that I got. So I decided to make a little project out of it, and answer at least the second question., with Google Analytics
